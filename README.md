#### Introduction:
This is a sorting Visualizer I made for my Cs50 Final project.
Pygame is used for the display.
It visualizes multiple sorting algorithims for anyone to learn from and enjoy. Additional features include Sliders for changing the speed and changing the number of bars; a rainbow mode
